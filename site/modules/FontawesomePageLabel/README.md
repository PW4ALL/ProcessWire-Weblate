# Font Awesome Page Label

**DEPRECATED**

This module is deprecated

###Yet another PageListLabel module?

- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) is really awesome, hundreds of high quality icons, ready to use. (Don't we all know how cool icon fonts are.)
- I wished to use icons in conjunction with the other PageList modules out there.
	(Page List Better Labels, Page List Image Label, Page List Show Page Id & Template Decorator)
- I wanted the possibility to style the icons individually with CSS.
- Showing icons triggered bij template name, but can be overruled bij Page ID.
	(Trash Page, 404 Page not found etc.)
- I wanted a better file or folder indication in the PageList tree.

### The Settings

![settings](https://github.com/Da-Fecto/FontawesomePageLabel/raw/master/settings.png)

### How to install


- Download the contents of this repository and put the folder renamed as **FontawesomePageLabel** into your site/modules/ folder.
- Copy the template **FontawesomePageLabel.php** to your **./site/templates/** folder.
- Login to processwire go to Modules and click "Check for new modules". You should see a note that a new module was found. Install the module.
- Press submit at the bottom at least one more time. (important)

**Important:** The Styles input in the settings need to have some data in it else it will be reinitialized. (You could leave a comment there.)

*aside: I recommend editting the template, so you could use your faforite editor to edit the CSS.*
