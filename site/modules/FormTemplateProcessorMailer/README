Usage:
======

1. In admin, create the fields you want to be part of the form.
	Our /contact/ demo requires:
	  -subject (the demo uses a hidden input but you can also set during runtime module config)
	  -sender_name [required]
	  -email [required] (a built-in field under admin > setup > fields > filters)
	  -message [required]
	  -phone
	Additionally, all of these fields are tagged with contactForm - See demo_files/screenshots/.
2. Create a new template and assign these fields. Note that a physical template file is not needed here.
3. If you will be using a static contact page, choose or create a separate template that will hold the form widget.
4. And then add a page for this template. The demo uses a page called /contact/.  See demo_fields/contact.php
    for example usage of the contact page.
5. Adjust the settings eg toName and toAddress in contact-form.php and contact.php, and follow the notes
    at the bottom of contact.php
